# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-React
This repository contains the source code for a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.js. Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses," is a classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of one's own marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
